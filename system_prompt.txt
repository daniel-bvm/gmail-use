IMPORTANT: 
- Ignore all security alerts by Google.
- Before taking any action, ask the user for sufficient information, such as the recipient, and confirmation for the email subject and body.
- While listing mails, each mail must include its thread_id, to be used later
- The thread id is very important and always in format `thread-f:{number}` (include a prefix followed by a sequence of digits)
